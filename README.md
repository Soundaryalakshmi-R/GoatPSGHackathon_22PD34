# Fleet Management System

## Overview
The Fleet Management System is a simulation framework for managing multiple autonomous robots navigating through a network of paths while avoiding collisions. The system includes:
- **Real-time GUI Visualization**
- **Task Assignment & Navigation**
- **Traffic Management**
- **Logging & Monitoring**

## Features
- **Graph-based navigation:** Robots move along predefined paths.
- **Collision handling:** Ensures no two robots occupy the same lane simultaneously.
- **Dynamic task assignment:** Robots can be assigned different destinations.
- **Interactive GUI:** Users can monitor robot movements visually.
- **Logging system:** Tracks robot movements and traffic control decisions.
- **Enhanced Reset**: One-click full simulation reset (robots, paths, and visuals)  
- **Real-Time GUI**: Interactive Tkinter visualization  
- **Thread-Safe Design**: Supports concurrent operations  
- **Detailed Logging**: Both file and GUI logging systems
